### Breaking Changes

#### Change in `isSnapshot` - now only tagged versions are not snapshots

Previously, because sbt-dynver generates a unique, stable version for each commit from a
non-dirty repository, it set `isSnapshot` to `false` for this case. This made sense
since these versions are stable, immutable identifiers that can be relied upon, for example,
for caching, but did not correspond to the intuition of a 'snapshot' as an intermediate,
non-released version. From version 2.0.0 onwards, `isSnapshot` will only be false for tagged
releases, and the key `isVersionStable` can be used to determine whether the current version
is a stable identifier, as well as a migration aid to sbt-dynve 2.x. [#23][]/[#42][] by [@raboof][]
