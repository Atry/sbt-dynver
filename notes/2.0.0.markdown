### Changes

- Consider untagged but 'clean' repositories as 'snapshots'.

Previously, because dynver generates a unique, stable version for each commit from a 
non-dirty repository, it set `isSnapshot` to `false` for all of these. This made sense
since these versions are stable, immutable identifiers that can be relied upon for example
for caching, but did not correspond to the intuition of a 'snapshot' as an intermediate,
non-released version. From version 2.0.0 onwards, `isSnapshot` will only be false for tagged
releases, and the key `isVersionStable` can be used to determine whether the current version
is a stable identifier.
